#follow the instruction when using frontend work


- Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure all flows are fully operable via keyboard and adhere to WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices. Every focusable element should have a distinct visual focus state.

- Variants: Utilize Tailwind CSS variants. Implement built-in classes like hover:, focus:, active:, disabled:, and aria- variants. 
  - Example: `<button class="focus-ring hover:bg-color-primary/80 disabled:opacity-50"> Submit </button>` 

- Placeholders: Use image placeholders for icons or avatars until real assets are available. 
  - Example: `<div class="image-placeholder"> <img src="/assets/image.svg" alt="icon" class="w-4 h-4" /> </div>` 

- Focus Management: Manage focus deliberately. 
  - Implement focus traps in modals and drawers. 
  - Adjust focus according to WAI-ARIA Patterns. 
  - Use `.focus-ring` for accessible indicators.

- Clipboard: Allow pasting. 
  - Do not disable paste in `<input>` or `<textarea>`. Users should be able to paste values (e.g., passwords, OTPs).

- State Persistence: Use the URL to maintain app state. 
  - Ensure refresh, back/forward navigation, and share links function seamlessly. 
  - Example: Utilize nuqs or query parameters.

- Tooltips: 
  - Delay the first tooltip by ~700ms, then display subsequent ones faster (~100ms).

- Overscroll Behavior: Set `overscroll-behavior: contain` intentionally, especially in modals/drawers to prevent background scrolling. 
  - Example: `.modal { overscroll-behavior: contain; }`

- Links: Use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation. 
  - Avoid replacing with `<button>` or `<div>`. 
  - Preserve browser defaults such as: 
    - Cmd/Ctrl + Click → open in new tab 
    - Middle click 
    - Right-click → open in new tab
